Tool with bad coding for private use. Ignore it :)

I hacked this together for a simple purpose: To control some old hardware i built years ago.

Why it's on gitlab/github? Because i wrote it twice,
the first time i lost the code (it was stored in a subdirectory
of the Android SDK and an update deleted it), that was stupid and
should not happen again...
