Tool with bad coding for private use. Ignore it :)

I hacked this together for a simple purpose: To control some old hardware i built years ago.

Why it's on gitlab/github? Because i wrote it twice,
the first time i lost the code (it was stored in a subdirectory
of the Android SDK and an update deleted it), that was stupid and
should not happen again...

currently I need to set:
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
otherwise:
    [javac] error: Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 6 or later.
    [javac] error: Target option 1.5 is no longer supported. Use 1.6 or later.
